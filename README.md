### Hey there

I'm Ivan, but you probably already knew that when clicking on my profile.

The majority of stuff you'll find here is just messy personal and robotics projects (assuming they're public), but feel free to look around.

A few things about me:
 - Student at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science
 - Former Strategy and Programming Lead of [FRC 5190](https://github.com/FRC5190)
 - Experienced in making mobile/web applications, but would rather just make games instead
 - Practically addicted to R6 and video games in general
 - Listens to a combination of pop-punk, metal, and classical music whenever possible
